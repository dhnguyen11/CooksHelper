# Cooks' Helper 
An app by David Nguyen

An application to create a personal online cookbook of your own favorite recipes. 
You may add your own recipes, or search our database for recipes added by other users. 
You can also add recipes to a grocery list, so you know what to buy the next time 
you go to the store.

Recipes can be added or removed from your cookbook by clicking the 'Favorite' icon 
at the top left of the recipe's page.  Recipes can also be designated as gluten-free 
or vegan-friendly for those with specific dietary needs.
